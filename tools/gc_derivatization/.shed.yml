description: Performs GC derivatization.
long_description: |
    The GC-derivatization tool converts carbonyl groups to C‚ïêN-OCH3 (MeOX) and transforms acidic protons into -Si(CH3)3 (TMS). Key functionalities include checking for 
    specific groups, removing derivatization groups, and adding derivatization groups to molecules.
