recetox-boxplot help
=====================
recetox-boxplot tool can be used to plot boxplots for the tabular data. On the input, a dataframe containing only columns to be plotted (i.e. we recommend to pre-filter the table for only numerical column with eventually first column holding the rownames) is expected. 

Typically, rows are features, columns are samples - if one wishes to plot the boxplots for the features, we recommend to transpose the table beforehand.

It is possible to use also different variable for the plotting - in that case, a metadata table can be supplied. The metadata table must contain a column which will map to the data table (e.g. SampleName).

It is also possible to use faceting, meaning splitting the plot based on multiple variables. One can then choose which variable to split the x axis and y axis on.
