description: "Mass spectra similarity scoring using a trained Spec2Vec model."
long_description: |
  "Spec2Vec is a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithmâ€”Word2Vec.
  Spec2Vec learns frag- mental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral 
  embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities."auto_tool_repositories:
